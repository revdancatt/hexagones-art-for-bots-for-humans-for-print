## About

As a follow up to [Hexagones Art for Bots for Humans](/Hexagones_Art_for_Bots_for_Humans-10800), which was itself an airdrop to [Hexagones Art for Bots](https://revdancatt.com/art/Hexagones_Art_for_Bots-8324) this project was a way to provide prints for people before fxhash introduced redeemables. Someone buying a [print from the shop](https://shop.revdancatt.com/collections/hexagones-print) gets the matching NFT version.

The experiment is ongoing. The full title "Hexagones - Art for Bots for Humans for Print" was too long for fxhash, and so some spaces were thrown out. I may add them back in, in a later project.
